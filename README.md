## General Info
This project is a small self-reminder of the dijkstra algorithm.

Plus, it can be used as a way to learn dijkstra using the color codes.
Some people, like me, may find it easier to learn from a visualization of an algorithm rather then reading it.

## Screenshots

## Technologies
* [P5.js](https://github.com/processing/p5.js)

## Features
* Creates random graphs.
* Randomaly chooses a source node.
* Runs the algorith on all nodes.
* You can click any node to see the shortest from the source node to it

## Status
Project is: _finished_.

## Inspiration
This project was inspired by the visualization seen in  Wikipedia's page for [Dijkstra's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm).
